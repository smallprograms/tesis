The most used algorithm to register point clouds into a common coordinate 
system is called Iterative Closest Point (ICP) \cite{mckay92}. Given two point clouds, 
this algorithm finds the best rigid transformation to align both clouds. 

This algorithm has some drawbacks, such as being susceptible to local minimum, 
have small convergence basin, and in general needing a high number of iterations \cite{Rusu2009}. 
For this reason additional techniques are used in combination with ICP to compute a good approximation 
of the desired rigid transformation. Some of these techniques involve to filter the point clouds prior 
to apply the algorithm, look for a good initial estimation of the transformation to reduce algorithm 
iterations, applying some optimization techniques to improve the overall result, etc. 


This proposal combines ICP with filtering techniques in order to work with RGB-D data, combining the use of geometrical 
and visual clues in order to reduce the computational cost and improve the obtained results. Also, a pose graph optimization 
algorithm is applied, obtaining promising results.
