\section{Software and hardware}

The software was programmed in C++ using Point Cloud Library (PCL) and OpenCV.

The Point Cloud Library (PCL) contains an ICP implementation, this implementation 
was modified accord to this proposal.

OpenCV contains most common image processing algorithms and it was used to calculate 
Optical Flow from dataset images. 


The program was executed on a notebook with Ubuntu 13.10 Operating System, 
CPU Intel i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz, 6 GB of RAM 
and a dedicated GPU Nvidia 650M of 2GB. Since software optimization is beyond of the scope 
of this thesis, no optimizations where perfomed and the software just used the CPU to 
made the calculations.
