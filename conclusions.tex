Proposed algorithm exihibit a very good performance in small trajetories (maximum 20 captures), 
most of the error is due to accumulated error. A more complete pose graph optimization algorithm 
should resolve this problem.

Using edges instead of the complete point cloud in order to perform the alineation of captures 
reduces algorithm complexity and exhibit noticeable improvements in the result.
