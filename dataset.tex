\section{Dataset}

The dataset \cite{sturm12iros} was used to get a quantitative evaluation 
of the proposed solution. The dataset consists of 39 sequences recorded in
two different indoor environments. Each sequence contains
the color (RGB) and depth map images, as well as the ground truth
trajectory from a motion capture system and  evaluation 
scripts.

The dataset contains the Kinect parameters (image principal point and focal length), the timestamp of each RGB image and depth map, 
and scripts to associate RGB images to depth maps. A detailed explanation of the data captured 
by the Kinect sensor was given in section \ref{sec:sensor_data}. This dataset is mainly used to test SLAM methods, where the 
interest is not only reconstruct the scene, but also know the trajectory of some moving vehicle equipped with
 sensors.
