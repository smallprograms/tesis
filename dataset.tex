\section{Dataset}

The dataset \cite{sturm12iros} was used to get a quantitative evaluation 
of the proposed solution. The dataset consists of 39 sequences recorded in
two different indoor environments. Each sequence contains
the color and depth images, as well as the ground truth
trajectory from a motion capture system. The dataset also includes evaluation 
scripts.
