A point feature is some characteristic that identifies the point and is desirable 
that points with geometrical similarities share similar features. For example..

\section{Point Neighboorhood}

In order to talk about point features is necessary to define a neighboorhood. 

We will define a neighboordhood of a point as a set of points that are related 
with it, sharing some common properties.

k neightboorhood : the k closests points 

radious neightboorhood : all the points that are within some radious

\section{Point Normal}

A very important geometrical property of a point is the normal. 
Because it indicates the orientation of the surface that contains it,
this property is heavily used in computer graphics to compute the 
lighting of an scene, since with the normals we can simulate the 
trajectory of an light ray that is intersecting the surface.
This property is also used as a point feature.



\section{Point Curvature}

The curvature is related with normal changes in a surface, 
a surface with no curvature will have all the normals pointing 
to the same direction.
